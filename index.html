            <p>Hello! My name is Valeria Ramirez and I am back in school after a very long time. I was interested in learning new things and skills and decided to jump back into structured learning by taking college courses. I completed my BA many moons ago but wanted to take courses I'm interested in with the only goal of learning and enjoying myself. I'm looking forward to taking more courses in CIS and possibly exploring other subject matters I did not learn during my undergraduate education. So far, this return to school is going great!</p>

            <p>My <strong>NEW</strong> favorite web site is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> because it has tons of resources.</p>
